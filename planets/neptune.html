      <div class="planet-info-containers">
        <div class="distance">
          <h1>Distance</h1>
          <p>The distance from Earth to Neptune can vary from 2.7 billion to 2.9 billion miles, depending on their positions in their respective orbits. This means that any mission to Neptune will require advanced propulsion technology and a significant amount of time to complete.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="time">
          <h1>Time:</h1>
          <p>Time is another critical factor to consider when planning a mission to Neptune. At its closest approach, the travel time from Earth to Neptune is still over 4 years, and at its farthest, it can take up to 12 years. Therefore, any spacecraft that Terra Ultra sends to Neptune will need to be designed to withstand the harsh conditions of space for an extended period of time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cost">
          <h1>Cost:</h1>
          <p>The cost of a Neptune mission is another significant consideration for Terra Ultra. Developing and launching a spacecraft capable of making the journey will require a substantial investment. Furthermore, the costs of maintaining and operating the spacecraft during its long journey must also be taken into account. Unfortunately, Individuals will not be able to travel to Neptune until futher notice.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="gravity">
          <h1>Gravity:</h1>
          <p>The force of gravity is another factor that must be accounted for when planning a mission to Neptune. The gravity on Neptune is approximately 1.14 times that of Earth, which means that a spacecraft must be able to withstand greater forces during landing and takeoff. Additionally, the effects of gravity must also be taken into account when designing the trajectory of the spacecraft during its journey.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="weather">
          <h1>Weather:</h1>
          <p>Weather conditions on Neptune are notoriously harsh and unpredictable, with high winds and extreme temperatures. Any spacecraft sent to Neptune will need to be equipped with advanced instruments to withstand these conditions and gather accurate data.

          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="living">
          <h1>Living:</h1>
          <p>Living and habitation conditions will also be a concern for Terra Ultra when planning a mission to Neptune. Given the long duration of the mission, the spacecraft must provide adequate living quarters for the crew, including provisions for food, water, and waste disposal.

          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="population">
          <h1>Population:</h1>
          <p>The population of Neptune is currently zero, but any mission to the planet will likely involve collecting data about its moons and other celestial bodies in the area rather than establishing any human habitation.

          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="training">
          <h1>Training:</h1>
          <p>Training will be crucial for the crew of any mission to Neptune. The crew will need to be highly skilled in operating advanced spacecraft and equipment, as well as dealing with the challenges of living and working in space for an extended period of time.

          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="vehicles">
          <h1>Vehicles:</h1>
          <p>The vehicles used for the mission will need to be specially designed to handle the unique challenges of space travel, including radiation exposure and the harsh conditions of the outer solar system. Terra Ultra will need to work closely with spacecraft manufacturers to develop the best vehicles for the job.

          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="safety">
          <h1>Safety:</h1>
          <p>Safety is always a top priority for Terra Ultra. Any mission to Neptune must be carefully planned and executed to minimize risks to the crew and the spacecraft. This includes thorough safety testing and contingency planning in the event of emergencies.          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="launch">
          <h1>Launch:</h1>
          <p>Launch is one of the most critical aspects of any Neptune mission. Terra Ultra will need to carefully choose the launch site and method to ensure that the spacecraft is launched safely as to reach its destination successfully. Terra Ultra will work closely with government agencies and space organizations to secure the necessary launch site and comply with regulations. Terra Ultra will likely use a rocket-propelled launch vehicle coupled a more advanced system, such as a solar sail or ion engine.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="recovery">
          <h1>Recovery:</h1>
          <p>Recovery is another critical aspect of a Neptune mission. After completing its mission, the spacecraft must be safely recovered and returned to Earth. Terra Ultra will need to plan for the recovery of the spacecraft, including the logistics of transporting it back to Earth and ensuring that it is retrieved safely.

            The recovery process will depend on the type of spacecraft used for the mission. If the spacecraft is designed to land on Neptune or one of its moons, it will need to be retrieved from the planet's surface or orbit. If the spacecraft remains in space, Terra Ultra will need to plan for its retrieval and transport back to Earth.</p>
