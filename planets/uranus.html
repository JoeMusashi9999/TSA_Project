        <div class="distance">
          <h1>Distance:</h1>
          <p>Terra Ultra is aware that Uranus is located quite far from Earth, with an average distance of about 1.8 billion miles. This distance poses a significant challenge for any mission to the planet, as it requires a spacecraft capable of enduring a long journey in deep space. Therefore, we are working on developing spacecraft that can handle such distances and have advanced propulsion systems to ensure timely arrival at Uranus.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="time">
          <h1>Time to Destination</h1>
          <p>Due to the distance of Uranus from Earth, any mission to the planet will require a significant amount of time. Terra Ultra has estimated that a typical mission to Uranus would take around ten years or more, depending on the trajectory chosen. Therefore, we are focusing on developing technologies that can ensure our spacecraft and crew can withstand such a long journey and still perform their tasks effectively upon arrival.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cost">
          <h1>Cost:</h1>
          <p>Terra Ultra is aware that a mission to Uranus would require significant financial investment. The costs involved in launching and operating a spacecraft for such a long journey are substantial. However, we are confident that the potential scientific discoveries and advancements in technology that could result from such a mission would be worth the investment.
            Unfortunately, Individuals will not be able to travel to Uranus until further notice.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="gravity">
          <h1>Gravity:</h1>
          <p>Uranus has a gravity of 8.69 m/sÂ², which is about 0.886 times that of Earth's. This means that any spacecraft or equipment sent to Uranus would need to be designed to withstand its unique gravitational pull. Terra Ultra is taking this into account during the design and development of our spacecraft to ensure their structural integrity and stability in the low-gravity environment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="weather">
          <h1>Weather:</h1>
          <p>Uranus is known for its extreme weather conditions, including strong winds and severe storms. Terra Ultra is taking these factors into account during the design of our spacecraft and equipment, ensuring that they are capable of withstanding the harsh conditions on the planet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="living">
          <h1>Living:</h1>
          <p>Terra Ultra recognizes that any mission to Uranus would require a suitable living and habitation environment for the crew. We are working on developing technologies that can provide a comfortable and safe living environment during the long journey and upon arrival at the planet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="population">
          <h1>Population:</h1>
          <p>Uranus is an uninhabited planet, and there is currently no human population on the planet. Terra Ultra's mission to Uranus is primarily focused on scientific discovery and exploration, rather than colonization.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="training">
          <h1>Training:</h1>
          <p>Terra Ultra understands that any crew sent to Uranus would require extensive training in spaceflight, as well as training specific to the mission objectives. We are providing comprehensive training programs for our crew to ensure their safety and success during the mission.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="vehicles">
          <h1>Vehicles:</h1>
          <p>Terra Ultra is designing spacecraft specifically for the mission to Uranus. These vehicles will be equipped with advanced technologies and systems to ensure their effectiveness and safety during the long journey and upon arrival at the planet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="safety">
          <h1>Safety:</h1>
          <p>Safety is a top priority for Terra Ultra. We are taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our crew and equipment during the mission to Uranus, including designing our spacecraft and equipment to withstand extreme conditions and providing extensive training for our crew.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="launch">
          <h1>Launch:</h1>
          <p>The launch of a spacecraft to Uranus is a significant undertaking, requiring advanced rocket technology and a launch site capable of supporting the mission. Terra Ultra is working with our partners to ensure a safe and successful launch of our spacecraft.

          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="recovery">
          <h1>Recovery:</h1>
          <p>Launch: The launch of a spacecraft to Uranus is a significant undertaking, requiring advanced rocket technology and a launch site capable of supporting the mission. Terra Ultra is working with our partners to ensure a safe and successful launch of our spacecraft.
