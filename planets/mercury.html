          <h1>Distance from Earth:</h1>
          <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, with an average distance of approximately 77 million kilometers (48 million miles) from the sun. However, due to the elliptical nature of its orbit, Mercury's distance from Earth varies greatly depending on its position in its orbit. At its closest approach, Mercury can be as close as 77 million kilometers (48 million miles) from Earth, while at its furthest, it can be as far as 222 million kilometers (138 million miles) away. This variation in distance presents significant challenges for launching and communicating with spacecraft to Mercury.

          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="time">
          <h1>Time to get to destination:</h1>
          <p>The time it takes for a spacecraft to reach Mercury depends on several factors, including its launch trajectory, the position of the planets in their orbits, and the speed and propulsion systems of the spacecraft. On average, it takes approximately 7-8 months for a spacecraft to reach Mercury. However, this time can vary greatly depending on the specifics of the mission. For example, if a spacecraft is launched during a period when Earth and Mercury are on opposite sides of the sun, the distance and travel time can increase significantly. Additionally, the speed and trajectory of the spacecraft can affect the travel time, with faster spacecraft able to reach Mercury more quickly. Despite these challenges, Terra Ultra is committed to developing advanced launch and recovery systems that can enable safe and efficient exploration of Mercury.

          <h1>Estimated cost:</h1>
          <p>Given these challenges and limitations, Terra Ultra has chosen not to offer flights to Mercury. Instead, our team is focused on developing innovative solutions for exploring and studying the planet through unmanned missions and advanced scientific instruments.          </p>

        <div class="gravity">
          <h1>Conditions::</h1>
          <p>One of the biggest challenges posed by Mercury is the extreme temperatures. With surface temperatures ranging from -173°C to 427°C, the planet presents significant challenges for equipment and materials. Terra Ultra is developing specialized materials and cooling technologies to ensure the durability and longevity of our equipment in this harsh environment. Mercury's proximity to the sun also poses significant challenges for communication and navigation. The intense radiation and solar flares can interfere with communication signals and damage equipment. Terra Ultra is developing advanced communication and navigation systems, as well as radiation shielding technology, to ensure the safety and reliability of our missions.

          <h1>Habitation:</h1>
          <p>Despite its limited commercial value, Mercury still presents unique scientific opportunities for studying the formation and evolution of the solar system. Terra Ultra is developing advanced scientific instruments and unmanned probes to study the planet's geology, magnetic field, and other important characteristics. Our team is also exploring the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze and interpret the vast amounts of data collected by our instruments.

          <h1>Vehicles & launch:</h1>
          <p>For launch, Terra Ultra is developing specialized rockets and spacecraft that are designed to withstand the intense heat and radiation of Mercury's environment. We are also working on advanced propulsion systems that can provide the necessary speed and trajectory to reach the planet efficiently. Our launch systems are equipped with state-of-the-art communication and navigation systems that ensure the safety and accuracy of our missions.</p>
