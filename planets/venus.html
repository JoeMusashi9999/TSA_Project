        <div class="distance">
          <h1>Distance:</h1>
          <p>As a space company, Terra Ultra recognizes the unique challenges posed by exploring and colonizing Venus. One of the biggest hurdles to overcome is the extreme distance from Earth to Venus. At its closest approach, the two planets are still over 38 million kilometers apart, making travel time and communication delays significant concerns. Terra Ultra is investing heavily in cutting-edge propulsion technology to minimize travel time and improve communication speeds, ensuring that we can efficiently and safely navigate the distance between the two planets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="time">
          <h1>Time to destination:</h1>
          <p>In addition to distance, time is another critical factor to consider when planning expeditions to Venus. With an average distance of 108 million kilometers from the sun, Venus takes roughly 225 Earth days to complete a single orbit. This long duration means that spacecraft must be able to endure prolonged periods of radiation exposure and extreme temperature fluctuations. Terra Ultra is developing advanced materials and radiation shielding technology to ensure the safety of our crew and equipment during extended missions.          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="cost">
          <h1>Cost:</h1>
          <p>With the cost of transport set at 1000 TerraUnits per million killometers, the cost to go to Venus will be on average 38000 TerraUnits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="gravity">
          <h1>Gravity:</h1>
          <p>The harsh gravitational environment of Venus also poses a significant challenge for Terra Ultra. With surface gravity roughly 90% that of Earth, Venus has a much more hostile environment for human habitation and exploration. Terra Ultra is developing specialized equipment and training programs to ensure the safety and well-being of our crew during missions, including advanced spacesuits and exercise regimens designed to maintain physical health in low-gravity environments.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="weather">
          <h1>Weather:</h1>
          <p>Weather patterns on Venus are notoriously extreme, with temperatures hot enough to melt lead and sulfuric acid rain. Terra Ultra is developing specialized weather monitoring and forecasting equipment to help predict and mitigate these dangerous conditions. Our team is also exploring the use of advanced materials and design techniques to ensure the durability and longevity of our equipment in this hostile environment.          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="living">
          <h1>Habitation:</h1>
          <p>To enable long-term habitation on Venus, Terra Ultra is developing cutting-edge living technologies designed to provide a sustainable and comfortable living environment for our crew. Our team is exploring the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar power and geothermal energy, to power habitats and scientific equipment. We are also researching innovative solutions for water and food production, including hydroponic farming and water reclamation systems.          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="population">
          <h1>Population</h1>
          <p>The population of Venus is currently zero, making it a blank slate for exploration and potential colonization. Terra Ultra is committed to responsible and sustainable exploration, ensuring that our activities on the planet do not harm the natural environment or endanger any potential indigenous life forms that may exist.          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="training">
          <h1>Training:</h1>
          <p>Terra Ultra recognizes that training is critical to the success of our missions. Our crew members undergo rigorous physical and mental training to prepare them for the unique challenges of living and working in space. Our team is also developing advanced virtual reality training simulators to help simulate the conditions and challenges of living and working on Venus.          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="vehicles">
          <h1>Vehicles:</h1>
          <p>Vehicles used for missions to Venus must be designed to withstand the harsh conditions of the planet, including extreme temperatures and atmospheric pressures. Terra Ultra is developing specialized vehicles, such as rovers and landers, capable of exploring the planet's surface and conducting scientific experiments. Our team is also exploring the use of drones and other unmanned vehicles to enable remote exploration and data collection.          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="safety">
          <h1>Saftey:</h1>
          <p> Safety is a top priority for Terra Ultra, and we are committed to ensuring the safety of our crew and equipment at all times. Our team is developing advanced safety systems and protocols to mitigate the risks associated with space travel and exploration. We are also exploring the use of artificial intelligence and autonomous systems to reduce the risk of human error and ensure mission success.          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="launch & recovery">
          <h1>Launch and Recovery:</h1>
          <p>Finally, launch and recovery operations are critical components of any mission to Venus. Terra Ultra is developing innovative launch and recovery systems that can operate safely and efficiently in the extreme conditions of space. Our team is exploring the use of reusable rockets and spacecraft, as well as advanced landing and recovery systems, to reduce the cost and improve the reliability of our missions. We are also developing advanced communication and navigation systems to enable precise and safe operations throughout the entire mission lifecycle.</p>
